Monsoon 14

The project was made under the course 'Introduction to Databases' in IIIT Hyderabad. The application uses PHP and MySQL to build a simple 
application to maintain a 'Grocery Store'. Manager can manage/add/delete items in the database. Proper care is taken for 
customer and employee profiles. Seperate pages are made for them. Customer can purchase an item after logging in. He can 
also view the status of the order. Employee has the privilege to change the status of the Order. Admin has the option
to grant privileges to the registered user. Main goal for making of this application was to learn MySQL queries and 
become familiar with PHP.
